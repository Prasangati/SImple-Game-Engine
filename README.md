# 2D Game Engine

## Overview
This project is a custom 2D game engine developed from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. It provides essential features such as rendering, texture management, shader handling, and window management. The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to integrate into various 2D game projects.

## Features
- **Rendering System**: Efficient 2D rendering using OpenGL.
- **Texture Management**: Load and manage textures using stb_image.
- **Shader Handling**: Compile and manage shaders with GLAD.
- **Window Management**: Create and handle windows and input using GLFW.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized code into reusable components and submodules.
- **Cross-Platform Build**: Configured using CMake for easy cross-platform builds.
- **Version Control**: Managed with Git for version control and project management.

## Technologies
- **C++**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLFW**
- **GLAD**
- **stb_image**
- **CMake**
- **Visual Studio**
- **Git**
