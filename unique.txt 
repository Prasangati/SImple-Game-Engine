In my game, I implemented a randomizer that randomizes the x position of the apple after it has fallen, whether it is caught
by the bucket or not. I also drew hearts in the corner to represent the number of times the player has not been
able to catch the apples. At the end, we get to see how many apples the player has caught, which is basically the number
of apples that have fallen minus three since the game is over when you fail to catch it for the third time.
